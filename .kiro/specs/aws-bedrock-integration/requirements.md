# AWS Bedrock Real Integration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing real AWS Bedrock integration within the Kairos Symbiotic AI system. The integration will enable direct access to multiple foundation models (Titan, Claude, Jurassic) through AWS Bedrock runtime, providing enhanced AI capabilities with production-ready performance and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AWS Bedrock Authentication & Connection

**User Story:** As a Kairos AI system, I want to authenticate with AWS Bedrock using real credentials, so that I can access foundation models securely and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL establish a secure connection to AWS Bedrock using environment variables
2. WHEN AWS credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback gracefully
3. WHEN connection is established THEN the system SHALL verify access to at least 3 foundation models
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times
5. WHEN credentials are rotated THEN the system SHALL detect and re-authenticate automatically

### Requirement 2: Multi-Model Foundation Model Support

**User Story:** As a developer using Kairos AI, I want to access multiple foundation models through a unified interface, so that I can choose the best model for each specific task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting AI inference THEN the system SHALL support Amazon Titan Text Express v1
2. WHEN requesting AI inference THEN the system SHALL support Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet
3. WHEN requesting AI inference THEN the system SHALL support AI21 Jurassic-2 Ultra
4. WHEN a model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to the next available model
5. WHEN model selection is automatic THEN the system SHALL choose based on task type and performance metrics
6. WHEN using any model THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent input/output formatting

### Requirement 3: Real-time Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a Kairos AI user, I want fast and efficient AI responses, so that the symbiotic collaboration feels seamless and natural.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making inference requests THEN the system SHALL achieve sub-2-second response times for standard queries
2. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL support at least 10 parallel inference calls
3. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL implement request batching where possible
4. WHEN caching is enabled THEN the system SHALL cache similar queries for 5 minutes
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track and log response times, token usage, and error rates
6. IF response time exceeds 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL timeout and retry with a different model

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Request Routing

**User Story:** As the Kairos AI system, I want to intelligently route requests to the most appropriate model, so that I can optimize for quality, speed, and cost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a code-related query THEN the system SHALL prefer Claude 3.5 Sonnet
2. WHEN receiving a general text generation request THEN the system SHALL prefer Amazon Titan
3. WHEN receiving a complex reasoning task THEN the system SHALL prefer Jurassic-2 Ultra
4. WHEN a preferred model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL route to the next best alternative
5. WHEN routing decisions are made THEN the system SHALL log the reasoning for audit purposes
6. WHEN load balancing THEN the system SHALL distribute requests evenly across available models

### Requirement 5: Error Handling & Resilience

**User Story:** As a Kairos AI system administrator, I want robust error handling and system resilience, so that the AI capabilities remain available even during partial failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS Bedrock returns an error THEN the system SHALL categorize it (rate limit, auth, model unavailable, etc.)
2. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff with jitter
3. WHEN a model fails THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to backup models
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL retry with circuit breaker pattern
5. WHEN errors persist THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully to local AI models if available
6. WHEN recovering from errors THEN the system SHALL automatically resume normal operation

### Requirement 6: Cost Optimization & Monitoring

**User Story:** As a Kairos project owner, I want to monitor and optimize AWS Bedrock costs, so that I can maintain budget control while maximizing AI capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making inference requests THEN the system SHALL track token usage and estimated costs
2. WHEN daily costs exceed threshold THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators
3. WHEN optimizing costs THEN the system SHALL prefer more cost-effective models for simple tasks
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide daily/weekly cost and usage summaries
5. WHEN budget limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement usage throttling
6. WHEN cost optimization is enabled THEN the system SHALL balance cost vs. quality automatically

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing MCP Servers

**User Story:** As a Kairos AI ecosystem, I want AWS Bedrock to integrate seamlessly with existing MCP servers, so that all AI capabilities work together harmoniously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Ultimate Symbiotic AI calls Bedrock THEN it SHALL use the same authentication and configuration
2. WHEN Amazon Q MCP integrates THEN it SHALL share Bedrock resources efficiently
3. WHEN Context Graph stores results THEN it SHALL include Bedrock model metadata
4. WHEN Browser MCP needs AI assistance THEN it SHALL access Bedrock through the unified interface
5. WHEN multiple MCP servers request inference THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access safely
6. WHEN sharing context between MCPs THEN the system SHALL maintain Bedrock session state

### Requirement 8: Security & Compliance

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want AWS Bedrock integration to meet enterprise security standards, so that sensitive data and AI interactions are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transmitting data to Bedrock THEN all communications SHALL use TLS 1.3 encryption
2. WHEN storing API keys THEN they SHALL be encrypted at rest using AES-256
3. WHEN logging interactions THEN sensitive data SHALL be redacted or hashed
4. WHEN accessing Bedrock THEN the system SHALL use least-privilege IAM policies
5. WHEN auditing is required THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive audit logs
6. WHEN data residency matters THEN the system SHALL respect regional data requirements

### Requirement 9: Configuration & Deployment

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want easy configuration and deployment of AWS Bedrock integration, so that I can manage the system efficiently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN all configuration SHALL be managed through environment variables
2. WHEN switching environments THEN the system SHALL support dev/staging/production configurations
3. WHEN updating configuration THEN changes SHALL take effect without system restart
4. WHEN validating setup THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information
6. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling across multiple instances

### Requirement 10: Monitoring & Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability of AWS Bedrock integration, so that I can ensure optimal performance and quickly identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL expose Prometheus metrics
2. WHEN tracking usage THEN the system SHALL integrate with Langfuse for observability
3. WHEN alerting is needed THEN the system SHALL support webhook notifications
4. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL provide time-series data for all key metrics
5. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide structured logging with correlation IDs
6. WHEN reporting status THEN the system SHALL provide real-time dashboard data via API endpoints
