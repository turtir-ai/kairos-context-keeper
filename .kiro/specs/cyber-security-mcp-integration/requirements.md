# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates essential cyber security MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools into our ultimate symbiotic AI ecosystem. The integration will enable autonomous security analysis, threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing capabilities through AI-driven automation. The system will create a symbiotic relationship between AI agents and security tools, allowing for continuous learning and adaptive security responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to integrate multiple security MCP tools into a unified AI system, so that I can perform comprehensive security assessments through natural language commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests security analysis THEN the system SHALL automatically select and coordinate appropriate MCP tools based on the analysis type
2. WHEN multiple tools are needed for analysis THEN the system SHALL orchestrate their execution in the optimal sequence
3. WHEN tool outputs are generated THEN the system SHALL correlate and synthesize findings into actionable intelligence
4. IF conflicting results occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on confidence scores and tool reliability metrics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a penetration tester, I want AI-driven vulnerability scanning and exploitation capabilities, so that I can identify and assess security weaknesses efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vulnerability scanning is requested THEN the system SHALL use Nuclei MCP for comprehensive vulnerability detection
2. WHEN web application testing is needed THEN the system SHALL integrate Burp Suite MCP for automated security testing
3. WHEN network reconnaissance is required THEN the system SHALL utilize Shodan MCP and NetworksDB MCP for asset discovery
4. IF potential vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL automatically prioritize them based on severity and exploitability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a malware analyst, I want automated reverse engineering capabilities, so that I can analyze suspicious files and binaries efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN binary analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL use Ghidra MCP for automated reverse engineering
2. WHEN file reputation checks are needed THEN the system SHALL query VirusTotal MCP for threat intelligence
3. WHEN hash analysis is required THEN the system SHALL integrate Hashcat MCP for password cracking (with ethical constraints)
4. IF malicious patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL generate detailed analysis reports with IOCs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a threat hunter, I want AI-powered threat intelligence and attack path analysis, so that I can proactively identify and mitigate advanced threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Active Directory analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL use BloodHound MCP for attack path identification
2. WHEN threat intelligence is required THEN the system SHALL correlate data from multiple sources (VirusTotal, Shodan, NetworksDB)
3. WHEN IOC analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL automatically enrich indicators with contextual threat data
4. IF attack patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest mitigation strategies and defensive measures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security operations center analyst, I want autonomous security monitoring and response capabilities, so that I can detect and respond to threats in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security events are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically triage and prioritize based on threat severity
2. WHEN incident response is triggered THEN the system SHALL coordinate multiple tools for comprehensive analysis
3. WHEN false positives are identified THEN the system SHALL learn and adapt to reduce future false alarms
4. IF critical threats are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate containment procedures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure and ethical tool integration, so that I can ensure compliance and prevent misuse of security tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools are integrated THEN the system SHALL implement strict access controls and audit logging
2. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL require explicit authorization and log all activities
3. WHEN ethical boundaries are approached THEN the system SHALL enforce usage policies and prevent unauthorized actions
4. IF compliance violations are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and halt problematic operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want extensible MCP integration architecture, so that I can easily add new security tools and capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new MCP tools are available THEN the system SHALL support plugin-based integration without core system changes
2. WHEN tool configurations change THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt without manual intervention
3. WHEN custom workflows are needed THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of tool orchestration patterns
4. IF integration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostics and recovery mechanisms
