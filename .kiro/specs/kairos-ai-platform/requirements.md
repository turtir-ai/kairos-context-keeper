# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Kairos AI Platform is a comprehensive developer productivity suite that transforms our existing MCP (Model Context Protocol) ecosystem into a production-ready B2B SaaS platform. The platform leverages 11 operational MCP servers to provide intelligent automation, code analysis, security scanning, and workflow orchestration for development teams.

The platform addresses the critical pain points of modern software development: fragmented tooling, manual code reviews, security vulnerabilities, and inefficient workflows. By unifying AI-powered analysis, browser automation, security scanning, and development tools into a single platform, Kairos AI Platform enables development teams to achieve 10x productivity gains.

5. IF research reveals critical competitor moves THEN the system SHALL send immediate notifications

### Requirement 4: Security Monitoring and API Key Protection

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want continuous monitoring of our codebase and network traffic for exposed secrets, so that I can prevent security breaches before they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL scan for API keys, passwords, and sensitive data
2. WHEN network traffic is analyzed THEN the system SHALL detect and mask any exposed credentials

5. IF critical secrets are exposed THEN the system SHALL block deployments until resolved

### Requirement 5: Workflow Orchestration and Automation

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to create custom workflows that chain multiple AI operations together, so that I can automate complex development processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating workflows THEN the system SHALL provide a visual drag-and-drop interface
2. WHEN workflows execute THEN the system SHALL chain MCP server calls with proper error handling
3. WHEN workflows fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed debugging information
4. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL store results and trigger downstream actions
5. IF a workflow step fails THEN the system SHALL retry with configurable backoff strategies

### Requirement 6: Real-time Collaboration and Notifications

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want real-time notifications and collaboration features, so that my team can stay synchronized on AI-generated insights and actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI analysis completes THEN the system SHALL send notifications via Slack, email, or webhooks
2. WHEN team members are mentioned THEN the system SHALL deliver personalized notifications
3. WHEN critical issues are detected THEN the system SHALL escalate to appropriate team members
4. WHEN insights are generated THEN the system SHALL allow team members to comment and collaborate
5. IF urgent actions are required THEN the system SHALL send immediate push notifications

### Requirement 7: Analytics and Performance Insights

**User Story:** As a engineering manager, I want detailed analytics on code quality trends and team productivity, so that I can make data-driven decisions about process improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display code quality trends over time
2. WHEN analyzing team performance THEN the system SHALL show productivity metrics and bottlenecks
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide exportable dashboards for stakeholders
4. WHEN trends are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest actionable improvements
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert managers with root cause analysis

### Requirement 8: Enterprise Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want enterprise-grade security controls and audit trails, so that our platform meets regulatory requirements and security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria
