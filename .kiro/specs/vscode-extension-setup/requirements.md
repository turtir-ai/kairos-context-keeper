# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need to properly configure VS Code with essential extensions for the Kairos project development environment. The project uses Python (FastAPI backend), React (frontend), Docker containerization, and various DevOps tools. The current issue is that some extensions are incompatible with the current Kiro IDE version, requiring alternative solutions and proper extension management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the Kairos project, I want to have all necessary VS Code extensions installed and configured, so that I can develop efficiently with proper syntax highlighting, debugging, and tooling support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer opens the project THEN the system SHALL have Python language support with IntelliSense
2. WHEN the developer works with React components THEN the system SHALL provide JSX syntax highlighting and snippets
3. WHEN the developer works with Docker files THEN the system SHALL provide Docker syntax support and container management
4. WHEN the developer commits code THEN the system SHALL provide Git integration with enhanced features

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve extension compatibility issues, so that I can use Docker and other essential tools without version conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an extension is incompatible with current IDE version THEN the system SHALL provide alternative solutions
2. WHEN extension installation fails THEN the system SHALL suggest compatible alternatives or manual installation methods
3. WHEN multiple extensions conflict THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated extension installation and configuration, so that I don't have to manually install each extension individually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the system SHALL provide batch installation commands
2. WHEN extensions are installed THEN the system SHALL configure them with project-specific settings
3. WHEN the setup is complete THEN the system SHALL verify all extensions are working correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want extension recommendations based on the project's technology stack, so that I only install relevant and useful extensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify required technologies (Python, React, Docker, FastAPI)
2. WHEN recommending extensions THEN the system SHALL prioritize extensions that support the identified technologies
3. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL categorize extensions by functionality (language support, debugging, formatting, etc.)
