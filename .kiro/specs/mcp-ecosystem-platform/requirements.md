# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MCP Ecosystem Platform is a comprehensive developer productivity suite that transforms our existing 11 MCP servers into a unified, production-ready platform. This platform will provide developers with AI-powered code analysis, security scanning, browser automation, and workflow orchestration capabilities through both CLI tools and a web dashboard interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access all MCP server capabilities through a unified web dashboard, so that I can manage and monitor my development tools from a single interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display the status of all 11 MCP servers
2. WHEN an MCP server is offline THEN the system SHALL show a red status indicator and error details
3. WHEN an MCP server is online THEN the system SHALL show a green status indicator and response time
4. WHEN a user clicks on an MCP server THEN the system SHALL display available tools and recent activity
5. IF all MCP servers are healthy THEN the dashboard SHALL show an overall "System Healthy" status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run automated code reviews on my Git repositories, so that I can catch issues early and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a Git repository THEN the system SHALL analyze all uncommitted changes
2. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide AI-powered code quality scores (1-10)
3. WHEN security issues are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight API keys, secrets, and vulnerabilities
4. WHEN the review is finished THEN the system SHALL generate a structured JSON report and human-readable summary
5. IF the repository has no changes THEN the system SHALL notify the user and suggest analyzing recent commits

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create custom workflows that chain multiple MCP servers together, so that I can automate complex development tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a workflow THEN the system SHALL provide a visual drag-and-drop interface
2. WHEN connecting MCP servers THEN the system SHALL validate input/output compatibility
3. WHEN a workflow is executed THEN the system SHALL process steps sequentially and handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN a step fails THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms and detailed error logs
5. IF a workflow completes successfully THEN the system SHALL save results and provide execution metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform comprehensive web research and competitive analysis, so that I can gather market intelligence and technical insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates research THEN the system SHALL use browser automation and search APIs
2. WHEN collecting data THEN the system SHALL extract structured information from multiple sources
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide AI-generated summaries and insights
4. WHEN sensitive information is found THEN the system SHALL mask or redact personal data
5. IF research takes longer than 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor network performance and security across my development environment, so that I can identify bottlenecks and threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL track latency, throughput, and connection health
2. WHEN security threats are detected THEN the system SHALL alert users and log incidents
3. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and recommendations
4. WHEN monitoring data is collected THEN the system SHALL store historical metrics for trend analysis
5. IF critical security events occur THEN the system SHALL immediately notify administrators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure and manage MCP server deployments, so that I can ensure reliable service availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying MCP servers THEN the system SHALL support Docker containerization
2. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate settings and restart services
3. WHEN servers crash or become unresponsive THEN the system SHALL automatically restart them
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling of MCP instances
5. IF resource limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL throttle requests and notify administrators

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate the platform with my existing development tools, so that I can enhance my current workflow without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with VS Code THEN the system SHALL provide extension support for inline features
2. WHEN connecting to GitHub THEN the system SHALL support webhook-based automated reviews
3. WHEN using Slack THEN the system SHALL provide bot commands for triggering workflows
4. WHEN working with CI/CD pipelines THEN the system SHALL offer API endpoints for automation
5. IF integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to track usage analytics and ROI metrics, so that I can measure the platform's impact on development productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the platform THEN the system SHALL track usage patterns and performance metrics
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide insights on time saved and issues prevented
3. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL identify most valuable features and optimization opportunities
4. WHEN calculating ROI THEN the system SHALL measure productivity gains against platform costs
5. IF privacy concerns exist THEN the system SHALL anonymize user data and respect privacy settings
