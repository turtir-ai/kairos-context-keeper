# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables seamless integration between Puppeteer MCP server and Amazon Q Symbiotic AI system, creating a powerful web automation and AI-assisted development workflow. The integration will allow Amazon Q to leverage browser automation capabilities for enhanced code assistance, project analysis, and symbiotic collaboration while providing real-time web research and testing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Amazon Q to automatically use Puppeteer for web research and testing, so that I can get more accurate and up-to-date assistance with my development tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Amazon Q receives a code assistance request THEN the system SHALL automatically determine if web research is needed
2. WHEN web research is required THEN Amazon Q SHALL use Puppeteer MCP to gather real-time information
3. WHEN Puppeteer automation completes THEN Amazon Q SHALL integrate the findings into its response
4. WHEN browser automation fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to cached knowledge

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Puppeteer to automatically test my web applications while Amazon Q provides intelligent feedback, so that I can identify and fix issues faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a web application testing request is made THEN Puppeteer SHALL navigate to the specified URL
2. WHEN page interactions are performed THEN Puppeteer SHALL capture screenshots and logs
3. WHEN testing completes THEN Amazon Q SHALL analyze the results and provide recommendations
4. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific debugging guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration to work autonomously with minimal configuration, so that I can focus on development rather than setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration is activated THEN both MCP servers SHALL automatically discover each other
2. WHEN communication is established THEN the system SHALL verify compatibility and capabilities
3. WHEN integration is ready THEN users SHALL receive confirmation with available features
4. WHEN either service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with reduced functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Amazon Q to use Puppeteer for automated documentation generation, so that my project documentation stays current with web-based examples and screenshots.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation generation is requested THEN Amazon Q SHALL identify web-based examples needed
2. WHEN web examples are found THEN Puppeteer SHALL capture screenshots and code samples
3. WHEN content is gathered THEN Amazon Q SHALL generate comprehensive documentation
4. WHEN documentation is complete THEN the system SHALL save it in the appropriate project location

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration to support real-time collaboration between human, AI, and browser automation, so that I can achieve faster development cycles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN symbiotic collaboration mode is activated THEN all three participants SHALL be synchronized
2. WHEN a development task is started THEN the system SHALL automatically distribute work appropriately
3. WHEN browser automation is needed THEN Puppeteer SHALL execute tasks while Amazon Q provides guidance
4. WHEN tasks are completed THEN all participants SHALL share results and insights

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration to handle authentication and security seamlessly, so that I can work with protected resources without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing protected resources THEN the system SHALL use stored credentials securely
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN Puppeteer SHALL handle login flows automatically
3. WHEN security tokens expire THEN the system SHALL refresh them transparently
4. WHEN security issues are detected THEN the system SHALL alert users and take protective measures
