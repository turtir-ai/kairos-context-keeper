# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive cyber security MCP ecosystem that integrates multiple security tools, threat intelligence sources, and network monitoring capabilities. The system will provide AI-powered automation for security workflows, combining passive reconnaissance, active scanning, threat intelligence, and vulnerability assessment tools through a unified MCP interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to integrate multiple cyber security MCP tools into a unified ecosystem, so that I can automate security workflows and correlate threat intelligence from various sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL automatically configure and connect to at least 10 different cyber security MCP servers
2. WHEN an MCP server connection fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
3. WHEN all MCP servers are connected THEN the system SHALL provide a unified dashboard showing connection status
4. IF any MCP server requires API keys THEN the system SHALL securely manage credentials through environment variables

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a penetration tester, I want to perform automated reconnaissance using multiple OSINT tools, so that I can gather comprehensive intelligence about target systems efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a target domain is specified THEN the system SHALL automatically query Shodan, VirusTotal, NetworksDB, and ZoomEye APIs
2. WHEN reconnaissance data is collected THEN the system SHALL normalize and correlate findings across different sources
3. WHEN duplicate or conflicting information is found THEN the system SHALL apply confidence scoring and prioritization
4. IF API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue requests and implement intelligent throttling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to perform automated vulnerability scanning and assessment, so that I can identify security weaknesses across my infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN target systems are identified THEN the system SHALL automatically run Nuclei vulnerability scans
2. WHEN web applications are detected THEN the system SHALL integrate with Burp Suite for automated security testing
3. WHEN vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL correlate findings with threat intelligence feeds
4. WHEN critical vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL generate automated alerts and reports

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a threat hunter, I want to analyze Active Directory environments and attack paths, so that I can identify potential security risks and lateral movement opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AD data is available THEN the system SHALL integrate with BloodHound for graph-based analysis
2. WHEN attack paths are identified THEN the system SHALL provide natural language descriptions of potential threats
3. WHEN new AD objects are discovered THEN the system SHALL automatically update the attack surface analysis
4. IF privilege escalation paths exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize and highlight high-risk scenarios

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a malware analyst, I want to perform automated reverse engineering and binary analysis, so that I can quickly understand malicious code behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN binary files are submitted THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze them using Ghidra MCP integration
2. WHEN mobile applications are analyzed THEN the system SHALL use Jadx MCP for decompilation
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports with AI-powered insights
4. IF suspicious patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL cross-reference with threat intelligence databases

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security operations center analyst, I want real-time network monitoring and threat detection, so that I can respond quickly to security incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network traffic is monitored THEN the system SHALL continuously analyze patterns for anomalies
2. WHEN threats are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically correlate with multiple threat intelligence sources
3. WHEN incidents occur THEN the system SHALL provide automated response recommendations
4. IF false positives are identified THEN the system SHALL learn and improve detection accuracy over time

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure configuration management and API key handling, so that I can maintain security while enabling automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate all required API keys and configurations
2. WHEN API keys are stored THEN they SHALL be encrypted and never logged in plain text
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN they SHALL be validated and backed up automatically
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and alert administrators

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want comprehensive reporting and data export capabilities, so that I can analyze findings and share intelligence with other teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports in multiple formats (JSON, PDF, HTML)
2. WHEN data export is requested THEN the system SHALL provide standardized formats compatible with SIEM systems
3. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL include executive summaries and technical details
4. IF sensitive data is included THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate redaction and classification
