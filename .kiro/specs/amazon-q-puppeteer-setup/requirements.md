# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an automated setup system for Amazon Q Developer integration using Puppeteer MCP for web automation. The system will handle authentication, configuration, and symbiotic AI collaboration setup through browser automation, eliminating manual setup steps and ensuring optimal configuration for the Kairos ecosystem.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically set up Amazon Q Developer through browser automation, so that I can quickly integrate it with my symbiotic AI ecosystem without manual configuration steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates Amazon Q setup THEN the system SHALL launch a browser session using Puppeteer MCP
2. WHEN the browser session starts THEN the system SHALL navigate to Amazon Q Developer authentication page
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL handle OAuth flow and token management
4. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL store credentials securely in the environment
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically configure Amazon Q Developer settings, so that it integrates seamlessly with my existing symbiotic AI tools and MCP servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication completes THEN the system SHALL configure Amazon Q Developer preferences automatically
2. WHEN configuring preferences THEN the system SHALL enable code assistance, project analysis, and symbiotic collaboration features
3. WHEN configuration is complete THEN the system SHALL update the MCP configuration with optimal settings
4. WHEN MCP configuration updates THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity and functionality
5. IF configuration fails THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the setup to integrate with my existing symbiotic AI context graph, so that Amazon Q can share knowledge and collaborate with other AI agents in my ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Amazon Q setup completes THEN the system SHALL create context graph nodes for Amazon Q integration
2. WHEN creating context nodes THEN the system SHALL establish relationships with existing AI agents and tools
3. WHEN relationships are established THEN the system SHALL enable cross-agent knowledge sharing
4. WHEN knowledge sharing is active THEN the system SHALL log symbiotic interactions for monitoring
5. IF context graph integration fails THEN the system SHALL continue with basic Amazon Q functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to validate the complete setup, so that I can be confident that Amazon Q Developer is working correctly with all symbiotic AI features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setup completes THEN the system SHALL run comprehensive validation tests
2. WHEN running validation THEN the system SHALL test code assistance, project analysis, and API connectivity
3. WHEN testing symbiotic features THEN the system SHALL verify context sharing and agent collaboration
4. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL generate a setup completion report
5. IF any validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps and retry options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the setup process to be fully autonomous, so that I can initiate it and let the symbiotic AI handle all configuration details without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts the setup THEN the system SHALL operate autonomously with minimal user input
2. WHEN autonomous operation is active THEN the system SHALL make intelligent decisions about configuration options
3. WHEN decisions are needed THEN the system SHALL use symbiotic AI reasoning to choose optimal settings
4. WHEN the process encounters obstacles THEN the system SHALL attempt multiple resolution strategies
5. IF manual intervention is required THEN the system SHALL clearly explain what user action is needed
