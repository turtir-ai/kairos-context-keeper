# Security MCP Integration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates comprehensive security testing and analysis capabilities into the Kairos symbiotic AI system using MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. The integration will provide automated security scanning, vulnerability assessment, network analysis, and penetration testing capabilities that work seamlessly with our existing AI-powered development workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Security MCP Server Integration

**User Story:** As a developer using Kairos, I want integrated security testing capabilities so that I can automatically identify and address security vulnerabilities in my projects without leaving my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure security MCP servers THEN the system SHALL automatically integrate with tools like httpx, nmap, cero, and other security scanners
2. WHEN security scans are initiated THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback and progress updates
3. WHEN security tools are executed THEN the system SHALL capture and parse all output for AI analysis
4. IF security tools are not installed THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions and automated setup options

### Requirement 2: Automated Vulnerability Scanning

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want automated vulnerability scanning of my applications and infrastructure so that I can proactively identify security issues before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request a security scan THEN the system SHALL automatically scan web applications, APIs, and network services
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. WHEN scan results are available THEN the system SHALL provide detailed vulnerability reports with remediation suggestions
4. WHEN scanning web applications THEN the system SHALL test for common vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, etc.)
5. WHEN scanning network services THEN the system SHALL identify open ports, service versions, and potential attack vectors

### Requirement 3: AI-Powered Security Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-powered analysis of security scan results so that I can understand the implications of vulnerabilities and receive actionable remediation guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security scan results are generated THEN the AI SHALL analyze findings and provide contextual explanations
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are identified THEN the AI SHALL suggest specific code fixes and security improvements
3. WHEN multiple vulnerabilities exist THEN the AI SHALL prioritize them based on risk assessment and business impact
4. WHEN remediation suggestions are provided THEN they SHALL include code examples and implementation guidance
5. WHEN security patterns are detected THEN the AI SHALL learn and improve future recommendations

### Requirement 4: Network Security Assessment

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive network security assessment capabilities so that I can identify and secure network vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initiate network scanning THEN the system SHALL discover active hosts and services on specified networks
2. WHEN network services are identified THEN the system SHALL assess their security posture and configuration
3. WHEN network vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL provide detailed technical analysis and remediation steps
4. WHEN scanning cloud infrastructure THEN the system SHALL assess AWS, Azure, and GCP security configurations
5. WHEN network topology is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify potential attack paths and security gaps

### Requirement 5: Integration with Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer using Kairos, I want security testing integrated into my development workflow so that security becomes a natural part of my coding process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I save code files THEN the system SHALL optionally trigger automated security analysis
2. WHEN I commit code THEN the system SHALL provide security feedback before the commit completes
3. WHEN I deploy applications THEN the system SHALL perform pre-deployment security validation
4. WHEN security issues are found THEN they SHALL be displayed in the IDE with clear visual indicators
5. WHEN working on security-sensitive code THEN the AI SHALL provide proactive security suggestions

### Requirement 6: Reporting and Documentation

**User Story:** As a security professional, I want comprehensive security reports and documentation so that I can track security posture over time and demonstrate compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security scans complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed HTML and PDF reports
2. WHEN multiple scans are performed THEN the system SHALL track security improvements over time
3. WHEN compliance requirements exist THEN reports SHALL include relevant compliance mappings (OWASP, NIST, etc.)
4. WHEN security metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be visualized in dashboards and charts
5. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL be automatically stored and organized by project and date

### Requirement 7: Custom Security Rules and Policies

**User Story:** As a security team lead, I want to define custom security rules and policies so that security scanning aligns with our organization's specific requirements and standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define custom security rules THEN the system SHALL apply them during all security scans
2. WHEN security policies are configured THEN they SHALL be enforced across all projects and scans
3. WHEN custom rules are created THEN they SHALL integrate with existing security tools and frameworks
4. WHEN policy violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations and remediation guidance
5. WHEN security standards change THEN rules and policies SHALL be easily updated and redistributed

### Requirement 8: Real-time Security Monitoring

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want real-time security monitoring capabilities so that I can detect and respond to security threats as they emerge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applications are running THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor for security anomalies
2. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately alert relevant stakeholders
3. WHEN security events occur THEN they SHALL be logged and correlated for threat analysis
4. WHEN monitoring thresholds are exceeded THEN automated response actions SHALL be triggered
5. WHEN security incidents are identified THEN the system SHALL provide incident response guidance
