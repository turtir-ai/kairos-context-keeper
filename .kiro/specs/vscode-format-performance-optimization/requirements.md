# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses performance issues related to VS Code's formatOnSave functionality, particularly in large projects, monorepos, or projects with multiple languages. When enabled, formatOnSave can cause significant delays during file saving operations, especially with heavy formatters like Prettier or Black, or when working with large files. This feature aims to provide optimized configuration options that maintain code formatting consistency while minimizing performance impact.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on large codebases or monorepos, I want to optimize VS Code's formatOnSave performance, so that I can maintain code quality without experiencing delays during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving a file with formatOnSave enabled THEN the system SHALL only format modified lines to reduce processing time
2. WHEN formatOnSave is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide configurable timeout settings to prevent excessive waiting
3. WHEN working with large files THEN the system SHALL offer alternative formatting strategies that don't impact performance
4. WHEN formatOnSave is causing delays THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostics to identify the source of slowdowns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with multiple programming languages, I want language-specific formatting configurations, so that I can optimize performance based on each language's formatter characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with different file types THEN the system SHALL apply language-specific formatOnSave settings
2. WHEN a specific language formatter is slow THEN the system SHALL allow disabling formatOnSave for just that language
3. WHEN multiple formatters are configured THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicts between them
4. WHEN a formatter is causing performance issues THEN the system SHALL provide language-specific timeout settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want workspace-level formatting configurations, so that all team members have consistent formatting behavior without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up a project THEN the system SHALL provide workspace-level formatOnSave optimizations
2. WHEN workspace settings are applied THEN the system SHALL override user-level settings for consistent behavior
3. WHEN formatters are configured THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with version control systems
4. WHEN new team members join THEN the system SHALL automatically apply optimized formatting settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want alternative formatting workflows that don't rely on formatOnSave, so that I can maintain code quality without impacting my development speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatOnSave is disabled THEN the system SHALL provide keyboard shortcuts for on-demand formatting
2. WHEN committing code THEN the system SHALL offer pre-commit hooks for formatting
3. WHEN formatOnSave is too slow THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative formatting tools or configurations
4. WHEN formatting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide bulk formatting options for selected files or directories
