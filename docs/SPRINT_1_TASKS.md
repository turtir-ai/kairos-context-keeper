## Current AgentCoordinator Capabilities âœ¨

The AgentCoordinator has evolved into a sophisticated flow management system with:

- **Flow State Machine**: Complete task lifecycle management
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Complex multi-task workflows with dependency resolution
- **Concurrency Control**: Configurable concurrent task execution limits
- **Health & Monitoring**: Agent health checks and system efficiency calculations
- **Communication Tracking**: Inter-agent message logging and analysis
- **Template System**: Reusable workflow templates for common patterns
- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed metrics, load balancing, and bottleneck detection
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic task distribution based on agent capacity

## Success Criteria for Sprint 1

1. **Robust Flow Orchestration**: System can handle complex workflows with multiple dependencies without failure
2. **Recovery Resilience**: Failed workflows can be recovered from checkpoints without data loss
3. **Performance Optimization**: System automatically optimizes task distribution and resource usage
4. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full visibility into workflow execution, performance, and health
5. **Integration Stability**: All components work together seamlessly under various load conditions
