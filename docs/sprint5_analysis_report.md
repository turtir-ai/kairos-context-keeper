# Sprint 5 Analysis Report: System Issues and Improvements

## Overview
This report analyzes the current issues in the Kairos system and provides solutions for improving task handling, Ollama integration, and implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Issues Identified

### 1. WebSocket Message Type Errors
**Problem**: The system is receiving task-related messages (`task_started`, `task_progress`, `task_completed`, `task_failed`) that aren't recognized by the WebSocket manager.

**Root Cause**: These message types are not defined in the `MessageType` enum and the fallback handling logic is incorrect.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added new message types to the enum
- Created proper message type mapping for legacy messages
- Implemented a dedicated `TaskHandler` class to manage task-related WebSocket messages

### 2. Ollama Connection Issues
**Problem**: While Ollama is running and has models available, the system isn't properly selecting and using them.

**Current Status**:
- Ollama is running at `http://localhost:11434`
- Multiple models are available including:
  - deepseek-r1:8b
  - llama3.1:8b
  - qwen2.5-coder:latest
  - mistral:latest
  - codellama:latest

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced model selection algorithm with performance scoring
- Added proper async handling for Ollama API calls
- Implemented fallback chain for model selection
- Added MCP context support for enhanced prompts

### 3. Task Assignment Problems
**Problem**: Tasks are not being properly assigned to agents through the WebSocket interface.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `TaskHandler` class to manage task lifecycle
- Integrated task handling with the agent coordinator
- Added proper task state management
- Implemented task progress tracking and broadcasting

### 4. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Not Implemented
**Problem**: The system lacks structured context management for LLM interactions.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created comprehensive MCP implementation with:
  - Context management (global, local, conversation history)
  - Tool registration and execution
  - Memory integration hooks
  - Agent coordination support
  - LLM response parsing

## New Components Added

### 1. Model Context Protocol (`src/mcp/model_context_protocol.py`)
A complete MCP implementation featuring:
- `MCPContext`: Manages conversation and system context
- `MCPMessage`: Structured message format for LLM communication
- `MCPTool`: Tool registration and execution framework
- Context formatting for LLMs
- Response parsing and message handling

### 2. Task Handler (`src/api/task_handler.py`)
Dedicated task management system with:
- Task lifecycle management (start, progress, complete, fail)
- Agent task assignment
- Task status tracking
- WebSocket broadcast integration
- Automatic cleanup of completed tasks

### 3. Enhanced LLM Router
Updated with:
- MCP context integration
- Enhanced prompt generation
- Better error handling
- Performance metrics tracking
- Model health monitoring

## Integration Points

### WebSocket Manager Updates
- Added new message types for tasks
- Improved message type mapping
- Better error handling for unknown message types

### LLM Router Enhancements
- MCP context support in generation method
- Enhanced prompt preparation with context
- Tool call parsing from LLM responses

### Main Application Updates
- Task handler initialization
- MCP integration
- Better error handling and logging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **WebSocket Task Messages**:
   ```javascript
   // Test task lifecycle
   ws.send(JSON.stringify({
     message_type: "task_started",
     data: {
       task_id: "test-123",
       description: "Test task",
       requires_agent: true
     }
   }));
   ```

2. **MCP Context Usage**:
   ```python
   # Create context
   context = mcp.create_context(
     project_id="test-project",
     initial_data={"user_preferences": {...}}
   )
   
   # Use in generation
   result = await ai_router.generate(
     prompt="Analyze this code",
     mcp_context=context
   )
   ```

3. **Ollama Model Selection**:
   - Verify model selection based on task type
   - Test fallback chain functionality
   - Monitor performance metrics

## Next Steps for Sprint 5

1. **Complete Integration**:
   - Wire up task handler in main.py
   - Test end-to-end task execution
   - Verify WebSocket message flow

2. **Memory System Integration**:
   - Connect MCP with memory manager
   - Implement memory search tool
   - Add context persistence

3. **Agent Improvements**:
   - Update agents to use MCP context
   - Implement tool-based agent invocation
   - Add agent performance tracking

4. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Update WebSocket client to use new message types
   - Add task management UI
   - Display MCP context information

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Error scenario testing

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Optimizations**:
   - Implement connection pooling (already in place)
   - Add indices for performance metrics queries
   - Consider partitioning for large datasets

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Redis for fast response caching
   - PostgreSQL for persistent cache
   - Context caching for MCP

3. **Model Selection Optimization**:
   - Cache model availability checks
   - Implement model warmup
   - Monitor and adjust selection weights

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all WebSocket messages
   - Sanitize task descriptions
   - Implement rate limiting

2. **Context Security**:
   - Ensure context isolation between users
   - Implement access controls
   - Audit context modifications

3. **Agent Execution Safety**:
   - Guardian agent validation
   - Sandboxed execution environment
   - Command whitelisting

## Conclusion

The implemented solutions address the core issues identified in the system:
- WebSocket message handling is now robust and extensible
- Task management is properly structured
- Model Context Protocol provides rich context for LLM interactions
- Ollama integration is enhanced with better model selection

These improvements lay a solid foundation for Sprint 5's continued development, enabling more sophisticated agent coordination and context-aware AI interactions.
