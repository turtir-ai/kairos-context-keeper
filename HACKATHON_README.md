## 🎯 **The Problem**

Modern software development suffers from **context fragmentation**:
- Long-running projects lose institutional knowledge
- Teams struggle with complex, interdependent codebases
- AI assistants lack persistent memory across sessions
- Manual coordination becomes a bottleneck in large projects

## 💡 **The Solution**

**Kairos** is an **autonomous development supervisor** that maintains persistent context awareness across your entire software development lifecycle. It combines:

- 🧠 **Layered Memory Architecture** - Working, episodic, semantic, and long-term memory
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Specialized AI agents for different development tasks
- 🔄 **Continuous Learning** - Self-improving through reflection and experience
- 🌐 **Hybrid AI Infrastructure** - Local and cloud AI models with intelligent fallbacks
